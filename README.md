# TypeScript-Typing

This is a repository to make things easier when installing modules and getting necessary tools configured
for starting new TypeScript projects. 

## How to get Started?

- First initialise your project via `yarn` | `npm` | `bun`: `yarn innit` for example

- Copy each of the code in the files and add it in your project ensuring you remain consistent with the file
naming. For `package.json` follow the next step.

- Copy the required arguments and paste it in `package.json` file. You shouldn't remove the title, description
and so on.

- Finally, in the terminal run `yarn run dev:install` and voila you've configured your TypeScript project
successfully!
