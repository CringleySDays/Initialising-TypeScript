# Initialising-TypeScript

This is a repository to make things easier when installing modules and getting necessary tools configured
for starting new TypeScript projects. This gets updated everytime I find something new that'll help

## How to get Started?

- First initialise your project via `yarn` | `npm` | `bun`: `yarn innit` for example

- Copy each of the code in the files and add it in your project ensuring you remain consistent with the file
naming. For [package.json](https://github.com/CringleySDays/TypeScript-Typing/blob/main/package.json) follow
the next step.

- Copy the required arguments and paste it in your `package.json` file. You shouldn't remove the title, description
and so on.

- Finally, in the terminal run `yarn run dev:install` and voila you've configured your TypeScript project
successfully!

## Need additional assistant?

- Open an [issue](https://github.com/CringleySDays/TypeScript-Typing/issues) and thoroughly explain it! ðŸ˜„

- If you want to add additional dependencies, once again open an [issue](https://github.com/CringleySDays/TypeScript-Typing/issues)

Happy Coding!
