# TypeScript-Typing

This is a repository to make things easier when installing modules and getting necessary tools configured
for starting new TypeScript projects. 

## How to get Started?

- First initialise your project via `yarn` | `npm` | `bun`. `yarn innit` for example

- Copy each of the code in the files and add it in your project. For `package.json` follow the next
step

- Copy the required arguments and paste it in `package.json` file. You shouldn't remove the title, description
