# Initialising-TypeScript

This is a repository to make things easier when installing modules and getting necessary tools configured
to start a new TypeScript project. This will get regular updates everything that I find new tools.

## How to get Started?

- First, choose the type of runtime that you would want to use for your project such as: [Node](https://github.com/CringleySDays/Initialising-TypeScript/tree/nodejs-main), [Bun](https://github.com/CringleySDays/Initialising-TypeScript/tree/bun-main) or [Yarn](https://github.com/CringleySDays/Initialising-TypeScript/tree/yarn-main)
  
- First initialise your project via `yarn` | `npm` | `bun`: `yarn innit` for example

- Copy each of the code in the files and add it in your project ensuring you remain consistent with the file
naming. For [package.json](https://github.com/CringleySDays/TypeScript-Typing/blob/main/package.json) follow
the next step.

- Copy the required arguments and paste it in your `package.json` file. You shouldn't remove the title, description
and so on.

- Finally, in the terminal run `yarn run dev:install` and voila you've configured your new TypeScript project
successfully!
