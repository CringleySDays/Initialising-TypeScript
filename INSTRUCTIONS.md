# Setting up your TypeScript Project

You'll find instructions on how to configure your projects, edit and include files and information.
I highly recommend you follow the instructions to avoid any errors and confusion.

## How to get Started?
  
- First initialise your project via `npm init` and fill out the necessary details.

- Download the [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/CringleySDays/Initialising-TypeScript/blob/nodejs-main/tsconfig.json), [.eslintrc.js](https://github.com/CringleySDays/Initialising-TypeScript/blob/nodejs-main/.eslintrc.js), [.prettierrc.js](https://github.com/CringleySDays/Initialising-TypeScript/blob/nodejs-main/.prettierrc.js), [.gitignore](https://github.com/CringleySDays/Initialising-TypeScript/blob/nodejs-main/.gitignore), and [.bash](https://github.com/CringleySDays/Initialising-TypeScript/blob/nodejs-main/.bash) files and add them to your project.

- Modify your package.json file by adding the contents from [package.json](https://github.com/CringleySDays/Initialising-TypeScript/blob/nodejs-main/package.json) file. Specifically, transfer the scripts,
dependencies, and devDependencies from the [source](https://github.com/CringleySDays/Initialising-TypeScript/blob/nodejs-main/package.json) file into the corresponding sections of your package.json file.

- Finally, in the terminal run `npm run dev:install` and voila you've configured your new TypeScript project
successfully!

## Need additional assistant?

- Open an [issue](https://github.com/CringleySDays/Initialising-TypeScript/issues) and thoroughly explain it! ðŸ˜„

- If you want to add additional dependencies, once again open an [issue](https://github.com/CringleySDays/Initialising-TypeScript/issues)

Happy Coding!
